    short_description: |
        This project demonstrates a workflow for generating high-quality synthetic tabular data using clustering-based seed instructions and the Synthetic Data Studio (SDS) API, ensuring statistical fidelity to real-world Lending Club loan data while preserving privacy. 
    long_description: |
        The project provides an approach to structured synthetic data generation, leveraging clustering to create statistical profiles (seed instructions) from real loan data, which guide a large language model (LLM) via the SDS API to produce realistic synthetic records. The workflow includes data cleaning, cluster-based feature engineering, synthetic data validation through LLM-based evaluation, and rigorous statistical comparison (e.g., KL divergence, correlation analysis) between synthetic and original datasets. By enforcing formatting rules, cross-column consistency, and domain-specific constraints, the pipeline balances data realism with privacy compliance, enabling safe use cases like model training or analysis without exposing sensitive information. The result is a reusable framework adaptable to diverse tabular datasets, with customizable parameters for model selection, quality thresholds, and evaluation criteria.
