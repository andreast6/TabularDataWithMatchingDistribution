    "In addition to the definitions above, when generating samples, adhere to following guidelines:\n",

    "Privacy Compliance guidelines:\n",
    "1) Ensure PII from examples such as addresses are not used in the generated data to minimize any privacy concerns. \n",
    "2) Avoid real PII in addresses. Use generic street names and cities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting guidelines:\n",
    "1) Use consistent decimal precision (e.g., \"10000.00\" for loan_amnt).  \n",
    "2) Dates (e.g. issue_d, earliest_cr_line) should follow the \"Jan-YYYY\" format.\n",
    "3) term has a leading space before the number of months (i.e. \" 36 months\")\n",
    "4) The address field is a special case where the State zipcode needs to be exactly as specified in the seed instructions. \n",
    "   The persons address must follow the format as specified in the examples with the State zipcode coming last.\n",
    "5) Any other formatting guidelines that can be inferred from the examples or field definitions but are not listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-row guidelines:\n",
    "1) Generated data should maintain consistency with all statistical parameters and distributions defined in the seed instruction\n",
    "   across records (e.g., 60% of `term` as \" 36 months\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-column guidelines:\n",
    "1) Ensure logical and realistic consistency and correlations between variables. Examples include but not limited to:\n",
    "   a) Grade/Sub-grade consistency: Sub-grade must match the grade (e.g., \"B\" grade → \"B1\" to \"B5\").  \n",
    "   b) Interest Rate vs Grade/Subgrade relationship: Higher subgrades (e.g., A5) could have higher `int_rate` than lower subgrades (e.g., A3).  \n",
    "   c) Mortgage Consistency: `mort_acc` should be 1 or more if `home_ownership` is `MORTGAGE`. \n",
    "   d) Open Accounts: `open_acc` ≤ `total_acc`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data distribution guidelines:\n",
    "1) Continuous Variables (e.g., `loan_amnt`, `annual_inc`): Adhere to the mean and standard deviation given in the seed \n",
    "  instructions for each variable.\n",
    "2) Categorical variables (e.g., `term`, `home_ownership`): Use probability distributions given in the seed instructions \n",
    "  (e.g. 60% for \" 36 months\", 40% for \" 60 months\").\n",
    "3) Discrete Variables (e.g., `pub_rec`, `mort_acc`): Adhere to value ranges and statistical parameters\n",
    "   provided in the seed instructions.\n",
    "4) Any other logical data distribution guidelines that can be inferred from the seed instructions or field definitions \n",
    "   and are not specified above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Background knowledge and realism guidelines:\n",
    "1) Ensure fields such as interest rates reflect real-world interest rates at the time the loan is issued.\n",
    "2) Generate values that are plausible (e.g., `annual_inc` ≤ $500,000 for most `emp_length` ranges).  \n",
    "3) Avoid unrealistic values (e.g., `revol_util` as \"200%\" is unrealistic).  \n",

    "1) Allow PII reducted addresses to ensure privacy is maintained. Also, ensure the records address's zipcode and state match the given values in the seed instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting guidelines:\n",
    "1) Check for consistent decimal precision.  \n",
    "2) Ensure dates (e.g. issue_d, earliest_cr_line) follow the \"Jan-YYYY\" format.\n",
    "3) Validate that term has space before the number of months (i.e. \" 36 months\")\n",
    "4) State zipcode needs to be exactly as specified in the seed instructions. The persons address must follow the format as specified in the examples with the State zipcode coming last.\n",
    "5) Any other formatting guidelines that can be inferred from the examples or field definitions but are not listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-column guidelines:\n",
    "1) Check for logical and realistic consistency and correlations between variables. Examples include but not limited to:\n",
    "   a) Grade/Sub-grade consistency: Sub-grade must match the grade (e.g., \"B\" grade → \"B1\" to \"B5\" possible subgrades).  \n",
    "   b) Interest Rate vs Grade/Subgrade relationship: Higher subgrades (e.g., A5) could have higher `int_rate` than lower subgrades (e.g., A3).  \n",
    "   c) Mortgage Consistency: `mort_acc` should be 1 or more if `home_ownership` is `MORTGAGE`. \n",
    "   d) Open Accounts: `open_acc` ≤ `total_acc`.  \n",
    "   Note: Do not deduct point points based on the installment amount and its relationship with interest rate, loan amount, and term. The relationship has already been verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data distribution guidelines:\n",
    "1) Check if the generated values are statistically possible and within any ranges given the parameters defined in the seed instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Background knowledge and realism guidelines:\n",
    "1) Ensure fields such as interest rates reflect real-world interest rates at the time the loan is issued.\n",
    "2) Check all generated values if they are plausible given real-world background information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring Workflow: \n",
    "1. Start at 10 points and deduct points for each violation:  \n",
    "   - Privacy Compliance: -1 points for any violations related to privacy guidelines.\n",
    "   - Formatting: -1 point for any violations related to formatting inconsistencies.  \n",
    "   - Cross-column: -4 points for any violations related to Cross-column inconsistencies.  \n",
    "   - Background knowledge and realism: -1 point for any violations related to Background knowledge and realism inconsistencies. \n",
    "     Note: Allow made-up PII information without deducting points.\n",
    "   - Other violations: -2 points for any other violations, inconsistencies that you detect but are not listed above.\n",
    "2. Cap score at 1 if any critical errors (e.g., PII leakage, missing fields).  \n",
    "4. Give a score rating 1-10 for the given data.  If there are more than 9 points to subtract use 1 as the absolute minimum scoring. \n",
