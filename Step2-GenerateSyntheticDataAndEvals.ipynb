    "### Step 0: Customize\n",
    "The first code cell in this notebook serves as the central configuration hub, enabling users to customize key parameters that define the behavior of the synthetic data generation workflow. This cell demonstrates several important customization capabilities through its variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API Endpoint Customization**  \n",
    "   - The `SDS_URL` variable allows users to specify the base URL for the Synthetic Data Studio API. This enables easy switching between different service instances or environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Selection**  \n",
    "   - The `GenerationInferenceType` and `EvaluationInferenceType` variables let users choose between different inference providers (e.g., CAII or AWS Bedrock) for data generation and evaluation.\n",
    "   - The `GenerationModelId` and `EvaluationModelId` variables allow specification of different model architectures for generation and evaluation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Endpoint Configuration**  \n",
    "   - The `GenerationEndpoint` and `EvaluationEndpoint` variables provide precise control over the specific model endpoints to be used for generation and evaluation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Path Customization**  \n",
    "   - Path variables (`Path`, `SDSPath`) enable users to specify where data files are stored and accessed, allowing adaptation to different directory structures or cloud storage configurations.\n",
    "   - Path defines this notebook path\n",
    "   - SDSPath defines where the SDS outputs files\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Input Data Specification**  \n",
    "   - The `InputData` variable lets users define the location of the original dataset used for reference in the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In step 2b, the variable needs to be updated with the file output in step 2a\n",
    "\n",
    "7. In step 3b, LLMJUDGEOUT needs to be replaced with the output of step 3a."

    "Create profile data for the LendingClub company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending platform connecting borrowers with investors. The dataset captures loan applications, \n",
    "borrower profiles, and outcomes to assess credit risk, predict defaults, and determine interest rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Loan Record field:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each generated record must include the following fields in the exact order provided, with values generated as specified:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- loan_amnt: The listed amount of the loan applied for by the borrower. If at some point in time, the credit department \n",
    "  reduces the loan amount, then it will be reflected in this value.\n",
    "- term: The number of payments on the loan. Values are in months and can be either \" 36 months\" or \" 60 months\".\n",
    "- int_rate: Interest Rate on the loan\n",
    "- installment: The monthly payment owed by the borrower if the loan originates.\n",
    "- grade: LC assigned loan grade (Possible values: A, B, C, D, E, F, G)\n",
    "- sub_grade: LC assigned loan subgrade (Possible sub-values: 1-5 i.e. A5)\n",
    "- emp_title: The job title supplied by the Borrower when applying for the loan.\n",
    "- emp_length: Employment length in years. Possible values are between 0 and 10 where 0 means less than one year and 10 \n",
    "  means ten or more years.\n",
    "- home_ownership: The home ownership status provided by the borrower during registration or obtained from the credit report.\n",
    "  Possible values are: RENT, OWN, MORTGAGE, ANY, OTHER\n",
    "- annual_inc: The self-reported annual income provided by the borrower during registration.\n",
    "- verification_status: Indicates if income was verified by LC, not verified, or if the income source was verified\n",
    "- issue_d: The month which the loan was funded\n",
    "- loan_status: Current status of the loan (Possible values: \"Fully Paid\", \"Charged Off\")\n",
    "- purpose: A category provided by the borrower for the loan request.\n",
    "- title: The loan title provided by the borrower\n",
    "- dti: A ratio calculated using the borrower’s total monthly debt payments on the total debt obligations, excluding mortgage\n",
    "  and the requested LC loan, divided by the borrower’s self-reported monthly income.\n",
    "- earliest_cr_line: The month the borrower's earliest reported credit line was opened\n",
    "- open_acc: The number of open credit lines in the borrower's credit file.\n",
    "- pub_rec: Number of derogatory public records\n",
    "- revol_bal: Total credit revolving balance\n",
    "- revol_util: Revolving line utilization rate, or the amount of credit the borrower is using relative to all available \n",
    "  revolving credit.\n",
    "- total_acc: The total number of credit lines currently in the borrower's credit file\n",
    "- initial_list_status: The initial listing status of the loan. Possible values are: w, f\n",
    "- application_type: Indicates whether the loan is an individual application or a joint application with two co-borrowers\n",
    "- mort_acc: Number of mortgage accounts.\n",
    "- pub_rec_bankruptcies: Number of public record bankruptcies\n",
    "- address: The physical address of the person\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the definitions above, when generating samples, adhere to following guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy Compliance guidelines:\n",
    "1) Ensure PII from examples such as addresses are not used in the generated data to minimize any privacy concerns. \n",
    "2) Avoid real PII in addresses. Use generic street names and cities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting guidelines:\n",
    "1) Use consistent decimal precision (e.g., \"10000.00\" for loan_amnt).  \n",
    "2) Dates (e.g. issue_d, earliest_cr_line) should follow the \"Jan-YYYY\" format.\n",
    "3) term has a leading space before the number of months (i.e. \" 36 months\")\n",
    "4) The address field is a special case where the State zipcode needs to be exactly as specified in the seed instructions. \n",
    "   The persons address must follow the format as specified in the examples with the State zipcode coming last.\n",
    "5) Any other formatting guidelines that can be inferred from the examples or field definitions but are not listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-row guidelines:\n",
    "1) Generated data should maintain consistency with all statistical parameters and distributions defined in the seed instruction\n",
    "   across records (e.g., 60% of `term` as \" 36 months\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-column guidelines:\n",
    "1) Ensure logical and realistic consistency and correlations between variables. Examples include but not limited to:\n",
    "   a) Grade/Sub-grade consistency: Sub-grade must match the grade (e.g., \"B\" grade → \"B1\" to \"B5\").  \n",
    "   b) Interest Rate vs Grade/Subgrade relationship: Higher subgrades (e.g., A5) could have higher `int_rate` than lower subgrades (e.g., A3).  \n",
    "   c) Mortgage Consistency: `mort_acc` should be 1 or more if `home_ownership` is `MORTGAGE`. \n",
    "   d) Open Accounts: `open_acc` ≤ `total_acc`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data distribution guidelines:\n",
    "1) Continuous Variables (e.g., `loan_amnt`, `annual_inc`): Adhere to the mean and standard deviation given in the seed \n",
    "  instructions for each variable.\n",
    "2) Categorical variables (e.g., `term`, `home_ownership`): Use probability distributions given in the seed instructions \n",
    "  (e.g. 60% for \" 36 months\", 40% for \" 60 months\").\n",
    "3) Discrete Variables (e.g., `pub_rec`, `mort_acc`): Adhere to value ranges and statistical parameters\n",
    "   provided in the seed instructions.\n",
    "4) Any other logical data distribution guidelines that can be inferred from the seed instructions or field definitions \n",
    "   and are not specified above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Background knowledge and realism guidelines:\n",
    "1) Ensure fields such as interest rates reflect real-world interest rates at the time the loan is issued.\n",
    "2) Generate values that are plausible (e.g., `annual_inc` ≤ $500,000 for most `emp_length` ranges).  \n",
    "3) Avoid unrealistic values (e.g., `revol_util` as \"200%\" is unrealistic).  \n",

    "\n",
    "Privacy Compliance guidelines:\n",
    "1) Allow PII reducted addresses to ensure privacy is maintained. Also, ensure the records address's zipcode and state match the given values in the seed instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting guidelines:\n",
    "1) Check for consistent decimal precision.  \n",
    "2) Ensure dates (e.g. issue_d, earliest_cr_line) follow the \"Jan-YYYY\" format.\n",
    "3) Validate that term has space before the number of months (i.e. \" 36 months\")\n",
    "4) State zipcode needs to be exactly as specified in the seed instructions. The persons address must follow the format as specified in the examples with the State zipcode coming last.\n",
    "5) Any other formatting guidelines that can be inferred from the examples or field definitions but are not listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-column guidelines:\n",
    "1) Check for logical and realistic consistency and correlations between variables. Examples include but not limited to:\n",
    "   a) Grade/Sub-grade consistency: Sub-grade must match the grade (e.g., \"B\" grade → \"B1\" to \"B5\" possible subgrades).  \n",
    "   b) Interest Rate vs Grade/Subgrade relationship: Higher subgrades (e.g., A5) could have higher `int_rate` than lower subgrades (e.g., A3).  \n",
    "   c) Mortgage Consistency: `mort_acc` should be 1 or more if `home_ownership` is `MORTGAGE`. \n",
    "   d) Open Accounts: `open_acc` ≤ `total_acc`.  \n",
    "   Note: Do not deduct point points based on the installment amount and its relationship with interest rate, loan amount, and term. The relationship has already been verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data distribution guidelines:\n",
    "1) Check if the generated values are statistically possible and within any ranges given the parameters defined in the seed instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Background knowledge and realism guidelines:\n",
    "1) Ensure fields such as interest rates reflect real-world interest rates at the time the loan is issued.\n",
    "2) Check all generated values if they are plausible given real-world background information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring Workflow: \n",
    "1. Start at 10 points and deduct points for each violation:  \n",
    "   - Privacy Compliance: -1 points for any violations related to privacy guidelines.\n",
    "   - Formatting: -1 point for any violations related to formatting inconsistencies.  \n",
    "   - Cross-column: -4 points for any violations related to Cross-column inconsistencies.  \n",
    "   - Background knowledge and realism: -1 point for any violations related to Background knowledge and realism inconsistencies. \n",
    "     Note: Allow made-up PII information without deducting points.\n",
    "   - Other violations: -2 points for any other violations, inconsistencies that you detect but are not listed above.\n",
    "2. Cap score at 1 if any critical errors (e.g., PII leakage, missing fields).  \n",
    "4. Give a score rating 1-10 for the given data.  If there are more than 9 points to subtract use 1 as the absolute minimum scoring. \n",
    "5. List all scoring justifications as list.\n",
